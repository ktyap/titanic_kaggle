## Titanic passengers survival prediction

Use of machine learning to model the likely survival of passengers onboard Titanic, using the Kaggle dataset [Titanic_Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

Since most females survived, a simple gender model that assumes all females survive would score an accuracy of 0.76555 in the test set hosted on Kaggle. The challenge is to improve on the metric of accuracy of the gender model by taking into account of other features.

**Note**: The best or optimal score for this challenge through machine learning techniques is a little over 0.80. A perfect score of 1 can be achieved by "overfitting" the known data exactly (the Titanic dataset, of which the Kaggle train and test sets are composed, is publicly available).
